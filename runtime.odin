A compiled template, the `with` proc will render the template into the writer using the given `this`.

Use 'Compiled.with' to render the template into the given (recommended to be buffered) writer with 'this' set to the given T in the template.
Use 'Compiled.approx_bytes' to resize your buffered writer before calling.

The returned n is the number of bytes written to the writer.
The returned err is any error that was returned by the writer.
